              Book Search works just like web search. Try a search on Google
                Books or on Google.com. When we find a book with content that
                contains a match for your search terms, we'll link to it in your
                search results. We've created reference pages for every book so
                you can quickly find all kinds of relevant information: book
                reviews, web references, maps and more. If the book is out of
                copyright, or the publisher has given us permission, you'll be
                able to see a preview of the book, and in some cases the entire
                text. If it's in the public domain, you're free to download a
                PDF copy. A book is a medium for recording information in the
                form of writing or images, typically composed of many pages
                (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together
                and protected by a cover.[1] The technical term for this
                physical arrangement is codex (plural, codices). In the history
                of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions
                or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, the scroll. A
                single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a
                page. As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a
                composition of such great length that it takes a considerable
                investment of time to compose and still considered as an
                investment of time to read. In a restricted sense, a book is a
                self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a usage
                reflecting that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on
                several scrolls and each scroll had to be identified by the book
                it contained. Each part of Aristotle's Physics is called a book.
                In an unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of
                which such sections, whether called books or chapters or parts,
                are parts.

                The intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition, nor even be called a book. Books can consist only of drawings, engravings or photographs, crossword puzzles or cut-out dolls. In a physical book, the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines to support entries, such as in an account book, an appointment book, an autograph book, a notebook, a diary or a sketchbook. Some physical books are made with pages thick and sturdy enough to support other physical objects, like a scrapbook or photograph album. Books may be distributed in electronic form as ebooks and other formats.
